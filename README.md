Repository for the 2024 BDSS Datathon

## How to Use

Hi all, so in preparation to the Datathon (which can be done even in the day) I would recommend the following steps:

1. Make sure you have a recent clean install of Python
2. Close this repository (easily done in VSCode connected to GitHub)
3. Create an environment (in VSCode you can do cntrl + shift + p and press > Python: Create Environment..., then select the venv option)
4. To install packages being used, activate the environment in the terminal (i.e., type .venv/Scripts/activate) and run pip install -r requirements.txt
5. If you want to add requirements you can activate the environment in shell and type pip freeze > requirements.txt
6. Commit small changes and push when you have a working something you want to share. I think its fine to do it to main
7. We need to discuss how to store data based on its size, but we might not want to commit it (and remember raw data is immutable)
8. Formatt all your stuff using Ruff, use names compliant to PEP8
9. We might want to think about writing modules later on
