# Process
1. Use Lasso to perform variable selection
2. Use identified variables to perform logistic regression

# Lasso
Yeehaw
1. Performed Cross Validation to select the optimal parameter
2. Ran Lasso


# Logistic (Logit)
1. Run logistic regression on the train dataset 
2. Get the predictions for test dataset

# Python
Pivoting was involved
Binary and encoded variables (removed ordinality and/or cardinality); our downfall
